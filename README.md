Install [tpm]((https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)) and copy this config into `~/.tmux.conf/`

If after sourcing the config file you get something like `~/.tmux/plugins/tpm' returned 126`, make sure the path to the tpm executable inside tmux.conf is correct and that tpm has permissions set to allow executing it
